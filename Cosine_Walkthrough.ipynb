    "A large majority of data scientistâ€™ time will be allocated to activities out of actual modeling. One issue that you could spend a ton of time on is data quality. Often in large corporations, the same data can be stored in a variety of places. Some of these places are easier to access than others or some sources are much faster than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the data comes from an external vendor, and you've been asked to confirm the data internally is the same. Whatever the situation is, you have been asked to compare two data sources for text documents & confirm that it is the same data. Another assumption to this walkthrough is that you believe you have a 1 to 1 relationship with each respective data sources text/document identifiers. To confirm at scale, we can use cosine similarity of the respective data sources to confirm they are a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "A score of over 80 would indicate the documents are very similar / same. The documents are unlikely to be a 100% match (score of 1) due to different encoding methods of the data sources. For instances, one data source could encode the data differently and when it's decoded special characters or additional information is introduced into the text. \n",
